# AI-Powered Geopolitical Analysis for Africa & the Middle East

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to develop an **AI-powered analysis system** to track and predict geopolitical trends in **Africa and the Middle East**. The system will leverage **machine learning, NLP, computer vision, and geospatial analysis** to provide insights into conflicts, economic trends, misinformation, and security risks.

## **Potential Use Cases & AI Models**

### **1. Conflict Prediction and Analysis**
- **AI Model:** LSTMs, Transformer-based forecasting.
- **Data Sources:** ACLED (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data), UN Reports, World Bank.
- **Output:** A dashboard highlighting potential conflict zones and early warnings.
- **Deployment:** **Streamlit dashboard** with real-time conflict trends.

### **2. Social Media Sentiment & Misinformation Detection**
- **AI Model:** BERT-based NLP sentiment analysis.
- **Data Sources:** Twitter (X), Reddit, Facebook, local news (Arabic, Swahili, Amharic).
- **Output:** Heatmaps of rising tensions and misinformation tracking.
- **Deployment:** **Render API for real-time analysis, Streamlit UI for visualisation.**

### **3. Resource Conflicts & Climate Impact Analysis**
- **AI Model:** Spatial AI (GIS + ML) for environmental risk prediction.
- **Data Sources:** NASA satellite imagery, FAO, climate change reports.
- **Output:** A geopolitical risk index based on environmental factors.
- **Deployment:** **Streamlit dashboard** with geographic visualisations.

### **4. Arms Trade & Military Movements Monitoring**
- **AI Model:** Computer vision (YOLO, CNNs) for satellite image analysis.
- **Data Sources:** Google Earth, Sentinel-2 imagery, OSINT.
- **Output:** Alerts of unusual military build-up.
- **Deployment:** **Render API for image processing, Streamlit UI for insights.**

### **5. Economic Sanctions & Financial Risk Analysis**
- **AI Model:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for illicit financial flows tracking.
- **Data Sources:** SWIFT transactions, FATF reports, IMF trends.
- **Output:** Predictive analysis of economic impacts of sanctions.
- **Deployment:** **Streamlit for scenario analysis, policy recommendations.**

### **6. Fake News Detection for Political Stability**
- **AI Model:** Transformer-based NLP model (BERT, T5, GPT-4) for misinformation detection.
- **Data Sources:** Local and international news sources.
- **Output:** Credibility scores for news articles.
- **Deployment:** **Streamlit UI for news verification.**

## **Deployment Strategy**
- **Streamlit**: Interactive dashboards for real-time updates.
- **Render**: API-based services for backend ML models.
- **FastAPI + Streamlit**: Hybrid approach with AI models running on **Render (backend)** and users interacting via **Streamlit UI**.

## **Next Steps**
1. Choose the primary focus area.
2. Collect and preprocess relevant datasets.
3. Train and fine-tune AI models.
4. Develop the **API & UI for deployment**.
5. Deploy on **Render + Streamlit** and optimise for real-time insights.
